##### About Me
* * *

My research is centered on the responsible development of machine learning systems, with a strong emphasis on safeguarding privacy, enhancing safety, ensuring fairness and maintaining factual integrity. Some of my recent work includes uncovering privacy risks in code generation models, investigating GPT models for factuality, developing a cybersecurity framework for disinformation threats, and mitigating biases in machine learning for high-risk applications like healthcare.

I recently completed my PhD at New York University, defending my dissertation titled *"Towards Responsible AI: Safeguarding Privacy, Integrity, and Fairness."* As a Global PhD Fellowship recipient, I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Christina P√∂pper](http://poepper.net){:target="_blank‚Äù} and an exceptional thesis committee whose guidance has been invaluable. 

I have been invited to share my research at prestigious forums such as *Microsoft Research* colloquium, the *MENA cybersecurity seminar*, and the *United Nations'* Department of Global Communications. My co-authors and I have received various research honors, including a *Health Equity & Global Health* best paper award at ML4H 2023, and runner-up for the *Andreas Pfitzmann Best Student Paper Award* at PETS 2024.

Previously, I have been at *Spotify Tech Research* and the *Center for Cyber Security*, applying privacy-enhancing technologies within existing digital platforms. These experiences reinforced my commitment to responsible machine learning practices.

I am currently on the job market, seeking opportunities to apply my expertise in organizations that share my vision for safe AI.

*Prospective PhD applicants, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, are encouraged to reach out with any questions about the PhD application process, the experience itself, or research in general.*
