###### About Me
* * *

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the Courant Institue, NYU. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Christina Pöpper](http://poepper.net){:target="_blank"}. In my research, I develop novel methods to mitigate online malicious activity and make the Internet a private and safer place. My work bridges end user desires and technical systems to realize privacy technologies utilizing a mix of _quantitative & qualitative analyses_, _machine learning_, and _applied cryptography_.

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
