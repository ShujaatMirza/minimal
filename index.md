###### About Me
* * *

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Courant Institute, NYU. I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Christina Pöpper](http://poepper.net){:target="_blank”} and supported by Global PhD Fellowship. In my research, I focus on better understanding and developing techniques to mitigate different forms of online abuse. Some of my recent research includes: designing training data extraction attacks to generate privacy leakage from code generation language models, characterizing threats of disinformation operations, and securing users’ right to be forgotten in their online activity. My work aims to realize privacy enhancing technologies utilizing a mix of _quantitative & qualitative analyses_, _machine learning_, and _applied cryptography_.
