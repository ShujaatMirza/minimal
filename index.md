###### About Me
* * *

I am a researcher dedicated to the responsible development of AI systems that prioritize privacy, safety, fairness, and factual integrity. My work focuses on identifying and mitigating risks in machine learning applications, particularly in critical domains like healthcare and cybersecurity.

I recently earned my PhD at New York University, where I was honored to be a Global PhD Fellowship recipient, working closely with my advisor [Dr. Christina Pöpper](http://poepper.net){:target="_blank"}. My research has been recognized with various honors, including a *Health Equity & Global Health Best Paper Award* at *ML4H 2023* and a runner-up for the *Andreas Pfitzmann Best Paper Award* at *PETS 2024*. Previously, I gained valuable industry experience at [Spotify Tech Research](https://research.atspotify.com){:target="_blank"} and the [Center for Cyber Security](https://cyber.nyu.edu){:target="_blank"}, where I incorporated privacy-enhancing technologies within existing digital platforms.

I am currently on the job market, seeking opportunities to apply my expertise in organizations that share my vision for safe AI. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out.

*Prospective PhD applicants and current students, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, are welcome to reach out with any questions about the application process, the PhD experience, or research in general.*
