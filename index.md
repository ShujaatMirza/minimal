#### About Me
* * *

I am a third year PhD candidate at NYU. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Christina Pöpper](http://poepper.net){:target="_blank"}. At present, I have several ongoing threads of research, mainly focusing on online data revocation, threat assessment of coordinated dis/mis-information operations on the web and tracking over the web, using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. My work bridges end user desires and technical systems, demonstrating the importance of that bridge in realizing privacy technologies, via solutions that rely on _applied cryptography_, and _machine learning_.

#### Previously
* * * 

I got a B.S. in Computer Science from New York University Abu Dhabi, where my capstone project was on Reimagining Privacy in Online Social Networks. During high school, I represented the national team in [International Chemistry Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemistry_Olympiad){:target="_blank"}.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
