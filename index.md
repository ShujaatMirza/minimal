###### About Me
* * *

I am a researcher passionate about developing responsible AI systems that prioritize privacy, safety, fairness, and factual integrity. My work centers on identifying and mitigating risks in machine learning applications, particularly in critical domains like cybersecurity and healthcare.

I recently earned my PhD at New York University as a Global PhD Fellowship recipient, working with [Dr. Christina Pöpper](http://poepper.net){:target="_blank"}. My research has been recognized with various honors, including a *Health Equity & Global Health Best Paper Award* at *ML4H 2023* and a runner-up for the *Andreas Pfitzmann Best Paper Award* at *PETS 2024*. Previously, I gained valuable experience with privacy-enhancing technologies at [Spotify Tech Research](https://research.atspotify.com){:target="_blank"} and the [Center for Cyber Security](https://cyber.nyu.edu){:target="_blank"}.

I am currently on the job market, seeking opportunities to apply my expertise in organizations that share my vision for safe AI. If you'd like to discuss potential collaborations, pI'd be happy to connect.

*Prospective PhD applicants and students, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, are encouraged to contact me about the application process, the PhD experience, or research.*
