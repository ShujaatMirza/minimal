##### About Me
* * *
<!--
In my research, I focus on better understanding and developing techniques to realize AI safety and privacy enhancing technologies.
-->
My research concentrates on enhancing the safety, privacy, and fairness of AI systems. Some of my recent projects involve exposing privacy vulnerabilities in code generation language models, identifying biases in medical imaging foundation models, developing a cybersecurity-inspired framework for disinformation, and auditing the reliability of LLMs for fact-checking. I am honored to be a recipient of the Global PhD Fellowship, working alongside [Prof. Christina P√∂pper](http://poepper.net){:target="_blank‚Äù} in advancing my research.

<!--
Some of my recent research includes: designing training data extraction attacks to generate privacy leakage from code generation language models, evaluating fairness of foundation models for medical imaging, and assessing reliability of large language models for fact checking tasks.

My work employs a mix of¬†_quantitative & qualitative analyses_, _machine learning_, and _applied cryptography_.
