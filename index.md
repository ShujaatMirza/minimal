### About Me
* * *

I am a third year PhD candidate at NYU. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Christina Pöpper](http://poepper.net). At present, I have several ongoing threads of research, mainly focusing on data revocation on the web (_the right to be forgotten_), threat assessment of disinformation campaigns on the web (_authentic news_) and tracking over the web (_online anonymity_), using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. My work bridges end user desires and technical systems, demonstrating the importance of that bridge in realizing privacy technologies, via solutions that rely on _applied cryptography_, and _machine learning_.
